```Compared to model 4, the variables in model three increased the r squared which means that they really help predict. These variables are Age midpoint, acetouch, and acehurt. I was surprised that the r squared didn't increase as much in model 4 because one of the variables in model 4 is depression and one would think that it has a significant correlation with marijuana usage.
